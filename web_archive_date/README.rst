Glue module between `web` and `base_archive_date`.

This module adds the `Latest Archived Date:` and `Latest Archived by:` as fields showing in the metadata of a record. Just like the `Latest Modification Date:` (write_date) or the `Created by:` (create_uid).

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

#. Install the module, archive a record and show on the Metdata of the record and you'll
be able to see the `Latest Archived Date` `Latest Archived by` there.
#. To check the Metadata:
* Activate the Developer Mode.
* Click on the `bug`, once the markdown appears, click on the View Metadata button.
* You can check the `Latest Archived Date` and `Latest Archived by` value once the record has been archived previously.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Format of `archive_date` is not the same as `write_date` shown in the metadata. Values are formatted in javascript. Can't inherit the method and adapt the value there.

TO BE DONE: Check how to format the value in the QWeb view somehow.
