This module adds the field 'Cost Share' in by-products and its logic as it is in odoo
v15 (added here https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/fd52760266ede3b9353936da8dc23e795f5a5031).

This field is the percentage of the final production cost for this by-product, so it
will affect the final product cost.
