By just installing this module, the `stock_picking_origin_reference_sale`
and `stock_picking_origin_reference_purchase` modules are auto-installed, if you have
corresponding *extension* modules installed, such as sale and purchase respectively.

These two modules together with this one, will enable the navigation to Sales Orders,
Purchase Orders and Transfers. All possible referenced models used in Odoo by default.
