This module adds popup announcements in the backend for targeted internal users. Those
announcements can contain rich format and a user read log is kept for everyone.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To create new announcements a user should be in the *Announcements Managers* group.
When your user has such permissions, this is the way to create an announcement:

#. Go to *Discuss > Announcements*
#. Create a new one and define a title. This title will be shown in the announcement
   header.
#. Define the announcement scope:

   - Specific users: manually select which users will see the announcement.
   - User groups: users from the selected groups will be the ones to see the
     announcement.
#. Define the announcement body. You can use rich formatting and event paste your
   own html (editor in debug mode).
#. By default, the announcement will be archived. This is to prevent the announcement
   to show up before time.
#. Once the announcement is ready, unarchive it going to the *Actions* menu an choosing
   the *Unarchive* option.
#. Optionally you can set an announcement date to schedule the announcement. The
   announcement won't show up until that date.
#. If the announcement doesn't make sense once a date is passed, you can set a due date.
   From that date, the announcement won't be shown to anyone.

There's a soft compatibility with OCA's `web_dialog_size` module. If the instance has
the module installed, you'll have the dialog resize controls by default in the
announcements. Additionally, you can show the announcement dialogs expanded to the
screen full width by default setting the system parameter key `announcement.full_size`
with to any value. Remove the parameter record to disable this behavior.

Usage
=====

When a user in the scope of active announcements logs in, those will popup. The user
has to mark them as read to continue working. If the announcement is set during the
user session, the announcement will be eventually prompted in the top bar on the right
part. The user click on the unread announcements icon (a speaker) and the announcements
will popup for the user to check them.

Users can go *Discuss > Announcements*  to check current and past announcements.
Announcement managers can also track which users have read the announcement.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It could be integrated in Discuss app to review past announcements.
* Log other information like geolocation, IP, browser agent, etc when marking
  announcement as read.
