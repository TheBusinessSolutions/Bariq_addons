When a user in the scope of active announcements logs in, those will popup. The user
has to mark them as read to continue working. If the announcement is set during the
user session, the announcement will be eventually prompted in the top bar on the right
part. The user click on the unread announcements icon (a speaker) and the announcements
will popup for the user to check them.

Users can go *Discuss > Announcements*  to check current and past announcements.
Announcement managers can also track which users have read the announcement.
