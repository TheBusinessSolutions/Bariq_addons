This module allows to encode more information to create lot/serial numbers
while processing an incoming shipment.

By default, you can only provide a lot/serial number name and its expiration date
when receiving products tracked by lot/serial numbers, while the other dates listed
below are automatically computed by Odoo.

* Lot/Serial Best before Date.
* Lot/Serial Removal Date.
* Lot/Serial Alert Date.

With this module you can also provide the information of those dates manually
overriding the automatic Odoo calculation.
